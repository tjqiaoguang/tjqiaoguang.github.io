                    <p>
                        At Our Team ("We", "us" or "our"), we are dedicated to safeguarding the privacy of our users ("you"). This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you about our practices regarding the collection, use, and storage of your personal data when you engage with our application (the "App"). We urge you to read this Privacy Policy thoroughly to comprehend our commitment to your privacy. By engaging with the App, you are consenting to the stipulations of this Privacy Policy. We may modify this policy occasionally. Should any changes occur, we will notify you by updating the policy on the App or our website, and through other suitable channels. Your continued use of the Services after such changes implies your consent to the updated policy.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="font-weight: 800;">1. Data Usage</h2>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For security measures and integrity of the system (preventing hacking, cheating, and other unauthorized or illegal activities).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To ensure compliance with legal obligations.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="font-weight: 800;">2. Data Collection Methods</h2>
